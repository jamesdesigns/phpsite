<h2>Biography:</h2>
<p>I have loved travel for as long as I can remember. At the age of 12 I asked if I could fly by myself to Hawaii and I never came back.</p>
<p> Right out of high school I started into travel school and have had the opportunity to work in many aspects of the industry.
    In every aspect I have worked I have had the opportunity to help people travel, to help fulfill people's dreams, what could 
    be better to do every day!
